Welcome! This is my first project that I will be working with to practice and demonstrate my git, html and github skills. I will be working to create a complete simple webpage with links, images, lists (ordered and unordered) and commit notes and being dilligent in my notations, allowing for someone to follow my work and also understand my thought processes and how I created this page.

Have fun is the main goal, and not rip out my hair.

God speed to me.
